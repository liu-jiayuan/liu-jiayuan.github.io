I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://csd.cmu.edu/">Computer Science Department</a> at Carnegie Mellon University and a member of the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~focal/">Foundations of Cooperative AI Lab</a>. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~conitzer/">Vincent Conitzer</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of economics and computer science, with a broader focus on AI.

I completed my undergraduate studies at the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (<a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/">Yao Class</a>) at Tsinghua University, where I was advised by <a href="https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~fang/">Zhixuan Fang</a>. In 2022, I visited the Harvard EconCS Group under the guidance of <a href="https://yiling.seas.harvard.edu/">Yiling Chen</a>. I also gained research experience through internships at Microsoft Research Asia in 2023, hosted by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/siweiwang/">Siwei Wang</a>, and at Shanghai Qizhi Institute in 2021, hosted by Zhixuan Fang. Additionally, I had the pleasure of collaborating with <a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Chongjie-Zhang.html">Chongjie Zhang</a>, <a href="https://i.cs.hku.hk/~zhiyi/">Zhiyi Huang</a>, and <a href="https://www.haifeng-xu.com/">Haifeng Xu</a> during my undergraduate years.
